## Hi there 👋
Hi, I’m Seoyoung Oh.
I have a strong interest in Healthcare and Medical AI, and I aspire to drive innovation in the medical
domain through the power of data and artificial intelligence. Among the many fields of AI and data
science, I find healthcare to be the most meaningful and impactful, as it directly relates to people’s
lives and well-being.
My academic focus is centered on exploring how AI and data-driven solutions can address real
world challenges in medicine, and I’m actively seeking opportunities to grow through research,
interdisciplinary collaboration, and practical applications in this field.
